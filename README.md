# Function Plotter

## Description

This is a Python GUI program that allows users to plot arbitrary mathematical functions of x. The program supports a variety of operators and functions, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, logarithms, and square roots. The GUI is built using PySide6, and the plots are generated with Matplotlib.

## Features

- Plot any user-entered function of x (e.g., `5*x^3 + 2*x`).
- Supports operators: `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `^`, `log10()`, and `sqrt()`.
- Allows users to specify the minimum and maximum values of x.
- Validates user input and displays error messages for invalid inputs.
- Simple and well-organized GUI.
- Automated tests using pytest and pytest-qt.
